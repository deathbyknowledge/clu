# Cloudflare Logging Utility
![CLU screnshot](clu.png)

## WIP Several improvments and evals incoming 

CLU is a pet project. It tries to build a CLI client for Cloudflare's API. Using AI :)

If you want to test it out, you can see it here [clu.defo.works](https://clu.defo.works/). For now, you need to add a [read-only API token](https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens) in local storage under 'auth': `localStorage.setItem('auth', YOUR_TOKEN)`;

Don't worry, your tokens are safe. You can read the code if you'd like, but if you're still concerned just deploy this yourself and hardcode your token. You gotta pay for the GPUs tho.
